**FPPI**:

To generate the FPPI figure, we utilize the same plotting code in [MPLD](https://github.com/sejong-rcv/MLPD-Multi-Label-Pedestrian-Detection), which yields slightly better results with this Python version code, namely 5.87, 5.97, and 5.68, respectively. 
Results of [ICAFusion](https://github.com/chanchanchan97/ICAFusion) are derived from latest output files provided by its authors.
